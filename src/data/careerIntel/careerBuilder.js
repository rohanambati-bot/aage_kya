/**
 * ============================================================
 * AI Career Intelligence Hub — Deterministic Career Builder
 * ============================================================
 * Turns a compact "seed" (a handful of hand-curated base numbers per
 * profession) into a fully expanded career record with derived fields —
 * salary timelines, 5/10-year demand forecasts, and Explainable-AI
 * "reason" strings that are template-generated FROM the seed numbers.
 *
 * Why a builder instead of hand-writing every derived field for every
 * profession: it keeps every number traceable to a small set of inputs
 * (baseSalaryLPA, growthRate, aiRiskBase, ...), which is exactly what
 * "explainable, not hallucinated" means in practice — every displayed
 * score has a formula you can point to, and every reason string quotes
 * the inputs that produced it.
 *
 * This file has ZERO dependencies on the existing app (no imports from
 * server/, no Supabase, no agents). It is pure, side-effect-free data
 * transformation.

/**

 *
 * BUG FIX: the previous version divided the compounded value by an
 * arbitrary "saturation" factor (1.35 at year 5, 1.9 at year 10) whenever
 * growth was non-negative. For any career with a modest positive growth
 * rate (e.g. Mechanical Engineer at +3%/yr), 5-10 years of compounding at
 * that rate is smaller than the divisor, so the divide-down effect always
 * won — the forecast line pointed DOWN even though the underlying growth
 * rate was positive. That's a materially misleading signal: a student
 * could see "demand is shrinking" next to a rising salary line for a
 * field the data itself says is growing. Compounding is now applied
 * directly with no hidden dampening, so the forecast's direction always
 * matches the sign of growthRatePercent — a positive rate can never
 * produce a declining line, and a negative rate can never produce a
 * rising one.
